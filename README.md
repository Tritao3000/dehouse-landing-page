# DeHouse Landing Webite

‚ÄãDeHouse is a joint venture between [WorkIn](https://www.workin.pro/) and [TAIKAI](https://taikai.network) to create the first web3 hub in Portugal üáµüáπ
Our dream is for it to become the physical intersection of the local web3 community ü§ù


An informal and dynamic space, exclusively dedicated to the ecosystem of Web3 organizations. The objective is to create a great vibe and flexible environment, with a decentralized workspace to enhance a positive work culture. A space with a strong sense of community, where everything can be co-developed, co-created, and co-shared. The place where we can meet people with the same interests, generate and discuss new ideas, creating synergies. Gather the right tools to ensure greater productivity in our work, an efficient network, and the perfect work/life balance

TAIKAI as of the partners of the main partner is calling allcommunity to contribute to this project and propose a landing page that serve as the main homepage for this community based initiative.

As a starting point we are providing information, logos and office photos that can be used to enrich and enhance the website appearance. 

The [DeHouse Landing Page Bounty](link) is taking place on [Bepro Network](https://app.bepro.network) and the best website will receive a reward of X BEPROs.
