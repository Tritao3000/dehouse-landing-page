# DeHouse Landing Website ‚òÄ

‚ÄãDeHouse is a joint venture between [Work-In](https://www.workin.pro) and [TAIKAI](https://taikai.network) to create the first web3 hub in Portugal. üáµüáπ

Our dream is for it to become the physical intersection of the local web3 community. ü§ù

An informal and dynamic space exclusively dedicated to the ecosystem of web3 organizations. The objective is to create a great vibe and flexible environment with a decentralized workspace, to enhance a positive work culture. A space with a strong sense of community, where everything can be co-developed, co-created, and co-shared. The place where we can meet people with the same interests, generate and discuss new ideas, creating synergies. Gather the right tools to ensure greater productivity in our work, an efficient network, and the perfect work/life balance.

TAIKAI, the leading partner's partner, is calling all the community to contribute to this project and proposing a landing page as the main homepage for this community-based initiative.

As a starting point, we are providing information, logos, and office photos that can be used to enrich and enhance the website's appearance.

### Website layout required
- Heroe (project presentation)
- Services provided
- Pricing talks about packs
- Contact section and co-work address, etc.
- Footer with important links (social websites)

All the typography should use the Space Grotesk font available on the TAIKAI press kit.

The DeHouse landing page bounty is taking place on [Bepro Network](https://app.bepro.network).
